# DNA-seq pipeline
This repository provides comprehensive documentation on the DNA-Seq analysis pipeline adapted from Genomic Data Commons (GDC) for the identification and annotation of somatic variants in whole exome sequencing (WXS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. The workflow encompasses six main procedures: 

Genome Alignment

Alignment Co-Cleaning

Somatic Variant Calling

Variant Annotation

Mutation Aggregation

 Aggregated Mutation Masking
